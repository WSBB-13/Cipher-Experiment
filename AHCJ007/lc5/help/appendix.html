<h2><a NAME="support">Technical Support</a></h2>
Registered LC5 users receive free technical support by email. To receive technical
support, you must include the Serial Number and Unlock Code from LC5's
<i>Help ... About</i> dialog in your email's Subject line, separated by two colons.
For example, a valid subject line might be:
<blockquote>
	<div class="mono">Subject: Using International Dictionaries?&nbsp; 1e15f863::13fc7b05</div>
</blockquote>
Registered users can send technical support questions to <a href="mailto:lc5@atstake.com">lc5@atstake.com</a>.
<p>
Technical support is not provided for non-registered users.

<h2><a NAME="system_requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<UL>
<li>Windows 2003, XP, 2000, NT
<li>1 GHz CPU
<li>50MB  disk space  (1.5GB  for pre-computed password tables)
<li>CD Drive
<li>Account with Administrator Privileges
</UL>
<b>Supported Password Environments</b>
<UL>
<li>Windows 2003, XP, 2000, NT

When installing LC5, you must be logged into an account that has administrator
privileges. LC5 runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems, and is
tested on Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. System requirements are the same as
the minimum requirements for the operating system.

<h2><a NAME="lc5_dependencies">LC5 Dependencies</a></h2>
LC5 relies on WinPcap software for packet capture and network analysis.
This package has shown some incompatibilities with PCMCIA network cards,
but good compatibility with other cards.  LC5 uses the currently installed version of WinPcap.

The latest version of WinPcap can be downloaded at <a href="http://winpcap.polito.it/">http://winpcap.polito.it/</a>

<h2><a NAME="word_list_format">Word List Format</a></h2>
You may use a word list of your own for dictionary cracks. To do so, your
word list must consist of a single word on each line of a simple text-based
file, as in the following example:
<blockquote>apple
	<br>dog
	<br>cat
	<br>peach
</blockquote>
The word list is not case sensitive, and will recognize both NT and Unix
formatted text files.
<h2><a NAME="resources">Resources</a></h2>
This section lists tools and information that may help in your password
auditing efforts. As always, exercise the appropriate diligence in evaluating
and using these resources.

<b>pwdump3</b><br>
As mentioned above, <a href="http://www.ebiz-tech.com/html/pwdump.html" target="_blank">pwdump3</a>
updates <a href="http://www.webspan.net/~tas/pwdump2/" target="_blank">pwdump2</a>
to allow remote access to the password database on SYSKEY protected systems,
and is available for free from e-business technology, Inc. Its output is
a similar format to the .lc format used by L0phtCrack 2.5. LC5 can import
files that <b>pwdump3</b> outputs.
<p>
<b>Password&nbsp;<a NAME="reset">Reset Utility</a></b><br>
You must have access to at least one administrator
account on a Windows 2000 machine in order to obtain password hashes from
that machine, whether you use <b>pwdump3</b>, or LC5's own <b>Import From Local Machine</b> feature.
The only other way to access the machine might be through a password
reset utility such as the following: <a href="http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/" target="_blank">http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/</a>.
<p>
<b>Source Code</b><br>
L0phtCrack 1.5 is available in an <a href="http://www.atstake.com/lc/download.html" target="_blank">open
source version</a>. 
<p>
<b>Note:</b> LC5 is approximately four times faster than
the L0phtCrack 1.5, due to optimization. The source version is essentially
a&nbsp; researcher’s version, made available to share information about
how the password auditing works. It is not intended as an audit tool for
production environments.
<p>
<b><a NAME="ntfsdos">NTFSDOS</a></b><br>
<a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/NTFSDOS.shtml" target="_blank">NTFSDOS</a>
is useful free utility for booting your system from a floppy to gain read-only
access to your hard disk's files. This can be useful for accessing a SAM
file (although SYSKEY-protected SAMs will not be auditable in LC5).

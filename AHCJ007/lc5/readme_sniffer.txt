******* NOTE!!!!  IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE SNIFFER!!!!!! **************

If you are experiencing difficulties with the sniffer, you probably need to 
upgrade to winpcap 2.3.  Do the following:

1. Download the winpcap 2.3 drivers from http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm
2. Run the winpcap installer
3. Copy Packet.dll and winpcap.dll from the windows/system32 directory to the LC4 
install directory (replacing the originals).

This should solve any sniffing issues.
